# AmazonBot
This project was designed to fetch the price of selected amazon products and email the price of them if they fit the specifications of the user. The script Amazon_Bot.py is designed to be the user interface, allowing one to create an account and add amazon links to the account, along with features such as being able to change how you want to recieve emails, changing your email, and viewing all your products. The script BotRunner.py is the script to apply to the bot, running a version of Amazon_Bot.py that updates all the products in the SQL database and sends out emails.
--How to run--
